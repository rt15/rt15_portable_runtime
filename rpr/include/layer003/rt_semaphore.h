 * The semaphore maximum value is the number of threads that can acquire it.
 * When you attempt to acquire a semaphore, you wait until its value is greater than zero.
 * When you acquire it, you decrement its value by one.
 * And when you release it, you increment its value by one.

 * If a name is provided, then the semaphore shared between processes.<br>
 * But beware that unlike shared mutexes, semaphores leak in case of process crash before calling ReleaseSemaphore/sem_post.
